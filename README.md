# 🔥 Hot Flash Tuning Suite

**Hot Flash** is a web-based performance tuning and simulation platform that blends
real-time telemetry dashboards with racing-sim-inspired ECU tuning interfaces.

Built entirely with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Hot Flash is designed to feel
like professional dyno and tuning software — without requiring installs, plugins,
or proprietary tools.

> ⚠️ **Status:** Open Alpha (Simulation / UI-first)

## 🧠 What Is Hot Flash?

Hot Flash is not a traditional automotive website — it’s a **browser-based tuning suite**.

The goal is to create a platform that:
- Looks and feels like real dyno / ECU software
- Is approachable like a racing game setup menu
- Can evolve into real OBD2 / CAN-based tuning in the future

Everything currently runs **client-side**, making it easy to demo, extend, and experiment.
